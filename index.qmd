**Hi there!**

Welcome to my personal website

I hold a Master's degree in Social Policy and Data Analysis from the University of Pennsylvania. I also have a Bachelor's degree in International Politics from Fudan University and a Bachelor's degree in Political Science from Waseda University.

**Where do I belong? I am still looking for.**

My passion lies in data analysis and visualization, and I enjoy working with tools like <span class="highlight">R, Python, Excel</span>, and mapping software such as <span class="highlight">ArcGIS</span> and <span class="highlight">QGIS</span>. I aim to leverage my skills to help people better understand and utilize policy and data to improve well-being. My interests particularly focus on health policy in the US and around the world.

In addition to my professional pursuits, I'm an avid fan of Broadway musicals and have a keen interest in photography. Explore my website to see my data-related projects and some of the photos I've captured along the way.
